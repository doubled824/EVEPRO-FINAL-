THE 2026 TRANSFORMATION
  
The OtoDerm Oxygen Dome Facial delivers a two-phase transformation: an immediate cosmetic "glow" followed by cumulative physiological improvements.

  
    
      
01. The First Time
      
Instant Radiance: You will see an immediate "glass skin" effect—skin appears visibly brighter, plumper, and hydrated.
      
Reduced Redness: Cooling purified oxygen instantly calms inflammation, ideal for sensitive skin.
      
Longevity: This initial "event glow" typically lasts between 4 to 7 days.
      
Deeper Absorption: Serums applied immediately after will penetrate deeper into the dermis.
    
    
      
02. Each Time After
      
Collagen Stimulation: Frequent treatments (every 1–2 weeks) progressively stimulate elastin production to reduce fine lines.
      
Acne Control: High-concentration oxygen prevents bacteria from thriving, leading to clearer skin.
      
Cellular Regeneration: Anion therapy neutralizes free radicals, improving overall tone and texture.
    
  

  
    
Recommended 2026 Schedule
    
Initial Phase: 1 treatment every 1–2 weeks (6 sessions total) to "jumpstart" cellular repair.
    
Maintenance: 1 treatment every 4 weeks to sustain "glass skin" clarity.

THE SCIENCE
    
Our OtoDerm H2O2 System is not a standard facial steamer. It uses a high-pressure generator to separate purified water into Hydrogen and Oxygen ions.
    
      
+ H2O2 Spray: Deep pore flushing
      
+ Bipolar RF: Collagen stimulation
      
+ Cold Hammer: Pores constriction
